4) Customizing batch_download script
    - 3 places to change
        1) header - variables for paths
        2) files_to_download - list of dictionaries of files to download
        3) end of download_files() loop/function - printing for each loop and final printing
5) Directory structure
    - batch_download.py assumes that there is a directory brain_data (specify path in header of script) that exists. Create if one does not exist. The script will create a directoy for each patient if one does not already exist (name of dir is patient_i)
